This set of Python scripts simulates the MIPS64 pipelines.
The allowed operations are L.D, S.D, ADD.D and MUL.D

To use the program:
1. Type “python Simulator.py” in console;
2. The program will prompt the user to type in the path to the instruction file;
3. The program will simulate the instructions and print out the timing table
   on console;
4. The program will then prompt the user to enter the filename to store the timing
   table. If no file extension is provided, the default ‘.txt’ extension will be
   added automatically;
5. The program will next output the FP register’s final values on console, and prompt
   the user to enter the filename to store the register results. If no file extension is 
   provided, the default ‘.txt’ extension will be added automatically.
